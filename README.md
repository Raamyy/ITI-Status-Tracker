# ITI-Status-Tracker
An automated checker that checks if ITI's application interview date is pending or determined.

It logs-in to the ITI portal and checks if the applicant's status page contains specifically `pending` word or not.

The code is inspired from this article [Web Scraping Behind Authentication With Python](https://medium.com/better-programming/web-scraping-behind-authentication-with-python-be5f82eb85f0).
